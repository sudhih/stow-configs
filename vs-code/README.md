# my VS code setup. 

> IMP: Content of `User` folder needs to be `copied` to `%AppData%\Code\User\` folder in Windows machine.</br>

> This configuration **requires** below plugins installed, to work.
- Dracula Official - colorscheme
- indent-rainbow for indent colors
- Ruff 
- Vim
- Rainbow CSV
- Settings Cycler
  - I preferred this plugin over `Toggle` because, this
  plugin lets you create user command via this plugin, which
  we can use to bind keys to this user command pretty
  convenient. Only drawback is `settings.json` file will be
  longer.
## Extensions from Microsoft
- Python
- Pylance
- Black Formatter
